# Eco-TSA

Here is the brief:
Develop an educational website that targets your community with information and solutions for
cutting down and eliminating the deposit of e-waste in landfills. You should present information
about the harm that electronics and batteries can cause when not properly disposed of, as well as
local solutions for properly recycling and/or disposing of these items. At a minimum, teams should
focus on batteries, cell phones, computers, and televisions in their solution. If the team wishes to
expand upon these requirements, they are welcome to do so.
Teams should strive to not develop a “book report.” The solution should be engaging, graphically
interesting, and easy to understand. Teams are reminded that the point of their solution should be
to educate the public on the harm of improper disposal of electronic devices, and to provide the
public with clear solutions for local options of proper disposal.
The solution must be presented as a separate website, independent of the required TSA and STEM
program information, with its own design and navigation. A separate host or domain is NOT
required. Teams must link to their chapter’s TSA information page from the design brief solution,
and vice versa.
